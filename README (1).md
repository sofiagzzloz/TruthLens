# TruthLens

TruthLens is a study companion built by students for students. It turns any note-taking session into a guided learning workflow by continuously fact-checking your content and offering targeted corrections that you can apply with a click.

## What It Does

* Provides a distraction-free workspace to draft or paste study notes
* Runs AI-powered fact checking on every sentence of a document
* Highlights claims that need attention and explains why they might be inaccurate
* Suggests improved wording along with trustworthy sources so learners can patch knowledge gaps fast
* Lets users accept a correction to rewrite their notes in place, keeping learning momentum

## Why We Built It

We attend an international university where lectures can be delivered in a language that is not the professor's first language. Class notes often end up messy, incomplete, or even incorrect. We wanted a tool that:

* Verifies claims before we revisit them for exams
* Surfaces reliable sources without manual searches
* Speeds up the study loop by integrating review and correction in the same UI
* Gives us confidence that our knowledge base is accurate without hours of fact-checking

TruthLens exists to make that feedback loop automatic for every learner.
